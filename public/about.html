  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>As a dedicated and passionate software developer, I have over two years of experience specializing in AEM (Adobe
    Experience Manager) development and Java Spring Boot. My journey into software development began with my deep
    curiosity for technology, and I have since developed a wide array of skills across front-end, back-end, and
    full-stack development. During my tenure at companies like TechChefz and Axeno Consulting, I have contributed to
    multiple projects, enhancing my expertise in building scalable, user-centric solutions. My proficiency in Java, AEM,
    and modern web technologies enables me to deliver high-quality digital experiences while maintaining efficient
    workflows.</p>

  <p>In addition to my hands-on experience in professional environments, I am also continually advancing my skills
    through dedicated learning. I am currently pursuing a full-stack development course from Scaler, focusing on data
    structures, algorithms, SQL, and backend low-level design. My commitment to self-improvement extends beyond formal
    education, as I often spend time refining my problem-solving skills, especially in areas like recursion and
    optimization, which are crucial in tackling complex software challenges. I am also passionate about mentoring and
    sharing knowledge, which has enabled me to collaborate effectively with teams and contribute to knowledge-sharing
    within the development community.</p>

  <p>As I continue to grow in my career, my goal is to combine my technical expertise with a user-centered design
    approach to develop innovative software solutions that make an impact. I am currently working on enhancing my
    full-stack capabilities, including exploring newer technologies and frameworks that can provide cutting-edge
    solutions to businesses. I am also keen on leading development projects, where I can apply my problem-solving skills
    and leadership to drive success. With a strong foundation in software development and a passion for continuous
    learning, I am committed to contributing to meaningful projects that help shape the future of technology.</p>
